**Gourmet Game**

A game implemented using .NET Windows Forms

A Tree structure is used, implemented in the class Node.cs

Whenever a new answer and question is learned, the game will update the decision tree with the new question in the proper place, which is, before the last question



**Running the project** 

The game requires .NETFramework Version=v4.7.2.

To run the game, Open the repo in Visual Studio IDE and run the project (F5)

Thanks a lot!
