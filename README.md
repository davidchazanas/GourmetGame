**Gourmet Game**


**Details**

A game implemented using .NET Windows Forms

A Tree structure is used, implemented in the class Node.cs

Whenever a new answer and question is learned, the game will update the decision tree with the new question in the proper place, which is, before the last question

The classes "Prompt" and "CenteredMessageBox" were created to ensure the dialogs are prompted in the position desired, which is centered at the parent with a AutoSize property.
